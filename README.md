# HW Week3 Day1 Inheritance

The Home Work has one part to be delievered before 9AM: 

----
## Part I
#### Create a superclass Shape has two attributes shapeName and shapeColor with two function info() return name and color of shape the second function is computeArea() return Dubole. Then create a three classes Rectangle, Triangle and Circle that extend from Shape class. You need to overwrite the computeArea() function in each subclasses to calculate the area.<br/>  Rectangle class has two attributes: width, height. Triangle has two attributes:  base, height. Circle has two attributes: pi, radius<br />

<br />

### Rectangle<br />
Attributes:  width, height<br />
Function: computeArea()
<br />
### Triangle<br />
Attributes:  base, height<br />
Function: computeArea()
<br />
### Circle<br />
Attributes:  pi, radius<br />
Function: computeArea()

<br/>
<br/>


```
Formulas to compute area:
`Circle area = pi times the radius squared (A = π*r²)`
`Rectangle area = height times width  (A = h * w)`
`Triangle area = half of height times base (A = (h * b)/2 )`
```
